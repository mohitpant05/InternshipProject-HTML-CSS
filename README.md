This is my Internship files folder where all the files are from my internship days when I learned a lot of things regarding new technologies  It also includes all the test cases I ran for to clarify my conceptual knowledge. 
In this project, I have learned many things about how websites work and how a webpage loads and presents coding lines in graphical visuals it was great learning these things.
